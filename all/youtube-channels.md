## Youtube Channels
* Russian Plus --He speaks in a mid-western English style but is very clear. The videos are good, if not very exciting. One, on visiting a sauna was too fast, but the one on body parts and the one on genitive case were each clear and better than a book because we hear the words spoken.
* The Russian Grammar Channel --Good video on hard and soft consonants. Good description of where to put one's tongue in order to pronounce them.
* Russian World from Dallas Schools Television--A little plodding. But they have some good features. Repetition is good. The * teacher grows on you and after the first couple, her Dallas accent is less intrusive. Also there are excellent penmanship sections. They build slowly at an appropriately gentle rate. Probably aimed at a young audience but teens at least. No talking down. The consecutive nature of the videos is very helpful. Russian level three of that course starts with a new teacher and an astoundingly basic review. I didn't watch that one, just did a quick look to see how far they had gotten. Nevertheless, solid, if stolid.
* Antonia Romaker --Living-room lectures on English and Russian grammar and usage.
* Easy Russian--Man-on-the street interviews on bland general-interest subjects such as "who is your favorite author".
* Christina Kochneva --Self-conscious dialogs filmed with alternating closeups
* Мизяка Дизяка--Vocabulary, number, alphabet, and phonetics videos for children
