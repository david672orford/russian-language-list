## Russian Cinema

<section>
<p>Movies are an important part of Russian culture.  The Soviet Union produced
comedies, adventure films, and cartoons.  Those made after the mid 1950's
remain extremely popular in Russia and other Eastern European countries. Russian
speakers have seen them all and refer to them frequently in conversation much
as Americans refer to <i>Star Wars</i> or <i>Casablanca</i>.</p>

<p>Westerners are surprised to learn that Soviet films are good entertainment.
Partly this is due to Cold War propaganda which portrayed Soviet culture as
grey and humorless. Partly it is because the Soviet watched in college courses,
available in stores, and streamed on Netflix are very old and have been
selected by film scholars for their importance to the history of the cinema. It
would be as if Hollywood were represented by Charlie Chaplin's <i>Modern
Times</i> and Orson Well's <i>Citizen Kane</i> while <i>Singing in the Rain</i>
and <i>Star Wars</i> were ignored.</p>

<p>Happily for the student of Russian, this situation has improved dramatically.
Hundreds of high quality, popular Soviet films are now available to watch
free of charge on Youtube. In most cases this is with the blessing of the
studios which produced them.</p>

<p>These films are an important resource for learning Russian language
and culture. Most of them are in color and have have clear soundtracks.
And most of them would be G-rated as will be discussed below.</p>

<h3>Objectionable Material in Soviet Film</h3>
<p>Few Soviet films have received an MPAA rating, but the vast majority would
be rated G with a few rated PG. There is a very small number of films at the
end of the Soviet period which would merit a PG-13 rating. None we are aware
of could conceivably be rated R.</p>
<ul>
<li>Offensive words: there is little swearing in Soviet films. 'Unprintable'
	words are not used at all. English subtitles sometimes use words which
	are much worse than what the actor is saying because the translators
	have learned their English from American films.</li>
<li>Alcohol use: Soviet films may include scenes in which characters are encouraged
	to drink and sometimes get drunk.</li>
<li>Tobacco use: There may be occasional smoking, but much less than in
	American films of the same period.</li>
<li>Sex: Up to the mid 1970's extramarital sex is hardly even hinted at,
	after that it is sometimes discussed or implied. Characters who engage
	in adultery or premarital sex generally face realistic unpleasant
	consequences.</li>
<li>Violence: levels of violence in Soviet films are low overall, seldom rising
	beyond a few punches. War, spy, and detective films may have more
	violence including people getting shot and bodies on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the above applies only to films made before the Soviet Union fell in 1991.
Russian films made after that may be very different.</p>

<h3>The Post-Soviet Russian Cinema</h3>
<p>After the decade after the fall of the Soviet Union Russian film makers
produced a large number of films which they would not have been allowed to make
earlier. Many of these, known as "боевики" prominently featured criminals,
firearms, and violence.</p>
<p>Russian studios now produce a variety of films. Many are romantic comedies
or sentimental films about orphaned children. These are known as "мелодрамы".
Other comedies are more like situation comedies or soap operas. These
sometimes contain coarse elements or portray characters whose self-indulgent
lifestyle is portrayed as normal.</p>
<p>We have not attempted to collect comprehensive information about modern
Russian films, but we do have a <a href="post-soviet">short list</a>
with a few examples.</p>
