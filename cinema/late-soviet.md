## Late Soviet Films

<section>
<p>After Stalin died in 1953 and Kruschef condemned him in 1955 the rules of
Socialist Realism were relaxed. The primary purpose of the Soviet cinema became
to entertain and to bring in money for the State. Comedies predominated.</p>
<p>These comedies contained few references to politics and they often make sly
references to the problems of the Soviet Union. Any propaganda in these late
Soviet films is of a generic 'mental hygiene' kind. At most they encourage
becoming a better person by accepting responsibility and taking pride in honest
work.</p>
