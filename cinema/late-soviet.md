## Late Soviet Films

<section>
<p>After Stalin died in 1953 and Kruschef condemned him in 1955 the rules of
Socialist Realism were relaxed. The primary purpose of the Soviet cinema became
to entertain and to bring in money for the State. Comedies predominated. They
contained few references to politics. They are full of sly references to the
problems of the Soviet Union. Any propaganda in these late Soviet films is of a
generic 'mental hygiene' kind. At most they encourage becoming a better person
improvement and taking pride in honest work.</p>
