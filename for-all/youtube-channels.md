## Youtube Channels
* [Russian Plus](https://www.youtube.com/user/RussianPlus)
	--Host speaks in a mid-western English style but is very clear. The videos are
	good, if not very exciting. One, on visiting a sauna was too fast, but the
	one on body parts and the one on genitive case were each clear and better
	than a book because we hear the words spoken.
* [The Russian Grammar Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/russiangrammar/)
	--Good video on hard and soft consonants. Good description of where to put
	one's tongue in order to pronounce them.
* [Russian World from Dallas Schools Television](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF2F566484C119BF4)
	--A little plodding. But they have some good features. Repetition is good.
	The teacher grows on you and after the first couple, her Dallas accent is
	less distracting. Also there are excellent penmanship sections. They build
	slowly at an appropriately gentle rate. Probably aimed at a young audience
	but teens at least. No talking down. The consecutive nature of the videos
	is very helpful. Russian level three of that course starts with a new
	teacher and an astoundingly basic review. I didn't watch that one, just
	did a quick look to see how far they had gotten. Nevertheless, solid, if stolid.
